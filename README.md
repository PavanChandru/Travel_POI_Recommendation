**Overview of the project**

This project revolutionizes travel recommendations using collaborative filtering (CF) methods: KNN, SVD, NMF, GSLR, and Two-Tower Neural Recommender. The Gowalla dataset from Kaggle includes user profiles, check-ins, locations, and friendships. The goal is personalized travel recommendations through preprocessing, CF features, and GSLR/Two-Tower models. Evaluation metrics include RMSE, MAE, precision, and recall.

**Introduction**

Transforming travel by tailoring destinations to individual preferences. Advanced machine learning models, CF (KNN, SVD, NMF), GSLR, and Two-Tower Neural Recommender are employed.

**Data Collection and Preprocessing**

Data Source : https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?id=0BzpKyxX1dqTYRTFVYTd1UG81ZXc&export=download
Data from Gowalla via Kaggle, including user friendships, features, location features, and check-ins. Merged tables provide insights into user behaviors, preferences, and social interactions.



**Preprocessing**

Users with fewer than ten check-ins or more than one hundred visits were excluded. Predictions focused on New York City locations for accuracy and reduced computational requirements. User data is anonymized.
